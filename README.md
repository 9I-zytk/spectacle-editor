## Overview

The initial setup of this project is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

[MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) and [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) are used for the store(s).

Note: Instead of actions, components call methods on the store(s) passed down via context.

Spectacle Editor leverages [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) for drag and drop functionality.

### Draggable elements

The elements that can be added to slides and edited include:

* Text
* Image
* Plotly chart
* Table
* Shape (V2)
* MathJax (V2)

Each element will have a corresponding property menu that is available when an element of that type is selected.

### Canvas

The canvas is the editable area that displays the current slide. Elements can be dropped on the canvas, repositioned and formatted.

### Slide list

The slide list displays all slides in the presentation and allows for changing the selected slide and reordering existing slides.

### Property menu

This is where options for the selected element will appear. The menu will depend on the type of element selected. If no element is selected a slide menu will appear.
