## Reporting Issues

Before opening an issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-editor)
to make sure that it doesn't already exist.

## Support Requests

We prefer that Github issues not be used for general questions or support requests. Instead, questions
can be asked on Stack Overflow.

## Pull Requests

We love pull requests. Contributions are welcome. That said, we do reserve the ability to edit,
modify or refuse any pull request that we don't think makes spectacle-editor better or fits our
vision for its future.

Before submitting a pull request please ensure that:

- You have written tests to support any added features
- You have run `npm run check` to make sure your code passes existing tests & lint
- Your pull request has a clear description of why you are submitting it
